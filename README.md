# Labs of High Performance Computing

The official introduction of the class is below:

>This course consists of three parts, parallel programming technology, programming optimization and grid computing technology. Parallel programming technology includes parallel programming over OpenMP and MPI respectively. Programming optimization covers usage of VTune and popular compilers, optimization method for high performance computing users. Grid computing is composed grid environment construction and usage, data grid deployment, grid application development and so on. This course will last 48 hours, 24 hours for parallel programming, 12 hours for programming optimization, and 12 hours for grid computing. Each parts of this course will be practiced through small course project at least.
